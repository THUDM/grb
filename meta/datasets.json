Instead of using the popular version of Cora used in Planetoid [1], we use a refined version [2], which removes duplicated nodes and generates indirect pre-trained word embeddings as node features to solve the problem of information leakage in the original version. As a result, the features become 302-dimension continuous features rather than 1433-dimension binary features in the original version. The task is to classify papers into 7 categories.",
