Graph Robustness Benchmark (GRB) provides scalable, general, unified, and reproducible evaluation on the adversarial
robustness of graph machine learning, especially Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GRB has elaborated datasets, unified
evaluation pipeline, reproducible leaderboards, and modular coding framework, which facilitates a fair comparison
among various attacks & defenses on GNNs and promotes future research in this field.
